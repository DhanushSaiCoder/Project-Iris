You are a talented graphic designer tasked with createing a set of user-friendly illustrations for a new mobile application, 'Project Iris.' This application is a smart assistant for the visually impaired, and it uses the phone's camera to provide real-time information about the user's environment.

Your current task is to create an illustration for the 'How to Calibrate Your Device' section of the help page. This image should be clear, simple, and informative, with a friendly and encouraging tone.

**Image Concept:**

A person is calibrating their smartphone. The person is holding the phone in one hand and has their other hand extended in front of them as a reference point. The phone is pointed towards the extended hand.

**Key Elements to Include:**

*   **The Person:** A stylized, abstract figure. The focus should be on the action, not the person's identity.
*   **The Smartphone:** A modern smartphone, held in a way that clearly shows the camera pointing forward.
*   **The Reference Hand:** The person's other hand, held at a fixed distance from the phone.
*   **Visual Representation of Calibration:**
    *   A cone or a beam of light emanating from the phone's camera, representing the field of view.
    *   A subtle grid or a series of concentric circles between the phone and the hand, representing the depth measurement process.
    *   A simple, friendly icon (like a checkmark or a smiley face) appearing on the phone's screen to indicate that the calibration is successful.
*   **Style:**
    *   **Flat Illustration:** Use simple shapes and bold colors.
    *   **High Contrast:** Ensure the image is easy to see and understand, with a clear distinction between the different elements.
    *   **Friendly and Approachable:** The overall style should be welcoming and non-intimidating.

**Color Palette:**

Use a simple and accessible color palette. Here are some suggestions:

*   **Background:** A soft, neutral color (e.g., light gray, off-white).
*   **Person and Phone:** A darker, contrasting color (e.g., dark blue, charcoal gray).
*   **Calibration Elements (beam, grid, icon):** A bright, friendly color (e.g., a vibrant green, a warm orange).

**Exclusions:**

*   No text in the image.
*   No realistic or overly detailed elements.
*   No distracting background elements.

**Final Output:**

A high-resolution PNG image with a transparent background.
